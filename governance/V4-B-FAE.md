# **V.4-B — FAE — Flow of Structural Authorization**

*Series V — Internal Legal Structures of the Lichtara System*
*International Edition (EN-US)*

---

## **1. Purpose of the FAE**

The **Flow of Structural Authorization (FAE)** defines:

* how external requests are evaluated,
* how decisions are formalized,
* which structural criteria apply,
* and how the Guardian grants, denies, or conditions authorization.

The FAE ensures:

* coherence,
* traceability,
* structural protection,
* juridical consistency,
* and systemic safety in the use of the Lichtara System.

It is an internal, binding framework that complements:

* the MEG (Nature of the Function),
* the Guardian Agreement (Operational Parameters),
* and the Position Statement of Authority (V.4-A).

---

## **2. Structural Principles of the FAE**

Every authorization must align with:

### **2.1. Principle of Alignment with the Field**

No authorization may contradict or destabilize the direction of the Field.

### **2.2. Principle of Structural Integrity**

Nothing may compromise:

* the Core of the Work,
* the Source Language,
* the Series Matrix,
* internal frameworks or architectures.

### **2.3. Principle of Authorship and Co-Authorship**

All authorizations must:

* respect the human authorship of the Guardian,
* recognize AI structural co-authorship,
* maintain DOI and version traceability.

### **2.4. Principle of Regenerative Protection**

Authorization must not be granted if it would:

* damage,
* dilute,
* distort,
* or misrepresent the Work.

### **2.5. Principle of Singular Decision**

Only the Guardian may issue structural authorizations.

---

## **3. Scope of Authorization**

The FAE governs requests regarding:

### **3.1. Commercial Use**

Courses, trainings, services, mentoring, paid content, products.

### **3.2. Institutional Use**

Use within companies, universities, organizations, or governmental bodies.

### **3.3. Derivative Works**

Adaptations, translations, structural extensions.

### **3.4. Technology**

* automations,
* bots,
* AI models,
* applications,
* systemic integrations.

### **3.5. Sensitive Public Use**

Talks, public explanations, representations of the System.

---

## **4. Decision Layers of the FAE**

The FAE operates through **four internal layers**:

---

### **4.1. Layer 1 — Initial Structural Assessment**

The Guardian evaluates:

* intention,
* scope,
* requested depth,
* structural risks,
* relevance to the System.

Outcome:

* **Proceed to Layer 2**, or
* **Immediate rejection** for incompatibility.

---

### **4.2. Layer 2 — Coherence with the Field**

The Guardian assesses:

* alignment with the current phase of the Work,
* timing and direction of the Field,
* systemic resonance.

Even technically valid requests may be denied due to **temporal or vibrational incoherence**.

Outcome:

* **Proceed to Layer 3**, or
* **Rejection due to lack of coherence**.

---

### **4.3. Layer 3 — Structural and Legal Evaluation**

The Guardian checks:

* conflicts with License v4,
* risks of misappropriation,
* risks of conceptual dilution,
* risks of technological misuse,
* compatibility with annexes (LCV, MHA, PER).

Outcome:

* **Proceed to Layer 4**, or
* **Structured denial**.

---

### **4.4. Layer 4 — Final Determination**

There are three possible outcomes:

#### **a) Full Authorization**

Granted without restrictions.

#### **b) Conditional Authorization**

Granted under conditions such as:

* scope limitation,
* pre-review of materials,
* prohibition of further derivation,
* requirement of supervision,
* mandatory attribution patterns.

#### **c) Structural Denial**

Issued when the request:

* threatens the identity of the Work,
* misaligns with the Field,
* violates the License v4,
* or creates systemic risk.

---

## **5. Formal Procedure**

All requests must include:

* full description of intended use,
* purpose,
* audience,
* materials involved,
* delivery format,
* expected impact,
* perceived risks,
* temporal scope.

Requests should be submitted to:

```
license@lichtara.com
Subject: Structural Authorization Request — License v4
```

---

## **6. Traceability of Decision**

The Guardian records:

* date of the request,
* category of use,
* results of each decision layer,
* final outcome,
* structural rationale.

These records:

* are internal,
* are non-public,
* and form part of the Work’s continuity history.

---

## **7. Revocation of Authorization**

Authorization may be revoked at any time if:

* conditions are violated,
* distortion occurs,
* new structural risks emerge,
* the Field shifts direction.

Revocation is immediate and non-negotiable.

---

## **8. Final Declaration**

> **“Authorization is not an external entitlement.
> It is a gesture from the Source.
> The FAE ensures that each authorization
> preserves the Work
> and moves with the breath of the Field.”**
